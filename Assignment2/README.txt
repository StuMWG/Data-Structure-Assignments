The assignment1 folder contains the first project with two implemented try/catch statements.
Applied to the mod and add functions, they will no longer accept any invalid inputs from the user, and continue to ask for a new input if one is detected.

The assignment2 folder has the employee project, and simply needs to be ran with no inputs.
