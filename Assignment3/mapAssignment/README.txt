This program contains the map portion of the assignment.
It allows the user to enter a state, and will return its capital.
It also replaces the value associated with the key "California", and replaces it to "Los Angelos".
When the program is exited, it will display all values in the map.
The inputs are case sensitive, with all states needing to be capitalized, and "exit" being lower case.
